METHODOLOGY

Participants

Seventeen healthy young adults consisting of 11 males and 6 females ranging in age from 22-31 years, (Age: 25.3±2.6 years; Height: 176.4 ± 8.7cm; Weight: 80.1 ± 17.5kg) participated in this study.  Prior to the testing the subjects signed an informed consent approved by the University’s Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Subjects with any known injury or pathology which could impair their ability to walk normally without assistance were excluded from the study.  

Instrumentation

All participants walked in a Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) system (Motek, Amsterdam, Netherlands). This device consists of a 2m x 3m instrumented treadmill embedded in a 4m – diameter platform capable of six degrees of freedom. The platform is surrounded by a 7m – diameter semi-circle of VR projection screens. The CAREN provides immersive VR while walking. Real-time position-tracking using 10 Vicon motion capture cameras (Vicon, Denver, CO) updates the participant’s location within the virtual reality environment in real time. 

Protocol

Participants performed a 5-minute warm-up followed by seven 4-minute treadmill-walking trials at a self-selected preferred walking speed (PWS) under the following conditions: (1) unperturbed baseline walking, (2) Static-image walking, (3) VR and (4) Platform translations, (5) congruent VR/Platform and (6) incongruent VR/Platform translations, and (7) a final baseline walking condition. In the oscillatory conditions, the treadmill and/or VR environment oscillated in the transverse plane. The VR and platform oscillations were fed by a 0.1Hz sinusoidal signal. 
Using a standardized protocol, the preferred walking speed of each participant was found before starting the experiment. Forward walking speed was determined for each participant by starting the treadmill and 0.8m/s and incrementally increasing the treadmill speed until the subject indicated that they had reached a comfortable speed. Once a comfortable speed was reached, the participant walked for 5 minutes to familiarize to the treadmill. After the familiarization trial, subjects filled out a motion sickness questionnaire to determine their comfort associated with the virtual reality environment. After every experimental condition, the subject was asked to indicate on a scale of 1 to 5, how difficult it was to maintain balance during walking. 

Data Processing and Analysis

Kinematic marker data were collected at 100 Hz using 10-camera infrared motion capture system (Vicon, Denver, CO). All subjects were outfitted with 31 reflective markers placed on anatomical landmarks (figure 1) and 4 additional landmarks were placed on each corner of the treadmill to allow for accurate kinematic data associated with platform movement. 
  
Data analysis was performed using MATLAB (Mathworks R2019b). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (IBM 2019) and Excel (Microsoft, 2019). The centroid of five pelvis markers (LASIS, RASIS, LPSIS, RPSIS, and Sacrum) were used to quantify the three-dimensional movement of the CoM. Frequency analysis was performed on the centroid for all conditions which was compared to the frequency analysis of treadmill and OF movement. 
Step length (SL) and step width (SW) values were calculated for both left-to-right steps and right-to-left steps. Left step length was defined as the AP distance between the leading left heel marker and the trailing right heel marker for each left heel strike. Left step width was defined as the ML distance between the leading left heel marker and the trailing right heel marker for each left heel strike.   Right step length was defined as the AP distance between the leading right heel marker and the trailing left heel marker for each right heel strike. Right step width was defined as the ML distance between the leading right heel marker and the trailing left heel marker for each right heel strike. Foot placement was displayed as a cluster of heel strikes for the left and right feet. Kinematic marker data was first normalized for platform rotation using a rotational matrix in MATLAB. After normalizing for platform movement, all heel strikes were normalized to the center of the treadmill using the sacrum marker as a reference point. Balance variability was quantified by finding the standard deviation of the pelvis centroid ML position for all subjects. Gait variability was quantified by finding the standard deviation of the pelvis centroid AP position for all subjects. COP trajectories were plotted using x/y COP information from two embedded force plates. Univariate analysis of variance (UNIANOVA) were used to test for significant condition effects for each of the dependent variables:  SL, SW, foot placement variability, COP trajectories, and CoM variability for each subject. Tukey post-hoc analyses were used to assess differences between conditions. Results were significant if p <0.05.
